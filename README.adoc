= Spock Katas

This workshop is composed of several small TDD exercises.

In order of complexity they are:

- The _Fizz/Buzz_ Kata
= The _Anagrams_ Kata
= The _Vending Machine_ Kata

Although you can build all the katas at once from the root it's probably best to `cd` into the kata you want to work on and build only that kata with `../gradlew`.

Each kata is designed to be approached in a test-first fashion so 100% code coverage is _required_.
Prepare to be shamed if your coverage is inadequate!

== Requirements

- JDK 8
- Git
