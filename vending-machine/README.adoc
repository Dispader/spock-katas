= Vending Machine Kata

A vending machine exposes the following methods:

  `void insert(Coin)`
  `void purchase(Item)`

The `insert` method:
- adds the value of a `Coin` to credit.

The `purchase` method:
- dispenses an item if there is sufficient credit.
- deducts the item cost from credit if an item is dispensed.
- returns change if an the amount of credit is greater than the cost of the item dispensed.
- throws `OutOfStock` if the requested item is out of stock.
- throws `InsertCoins` if there is insufficient credit to purchase the requested item.
- throws `CannotMakeChange` if it's impossible to dispense change for the purchase.
- does not dispense item or change it an exception is thrown.
- does not deduct from credit if an exception is thrown.
